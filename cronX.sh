# Call this from your crontab if you like.

# Note that thereâ€™s a new-ish limitation in Ubuntu that disables updating
# desktop things via `cron`. The `cronX` wrapper script (included) works
# around this, so use it to call `flickpapr`.
#
# You can test by simply running `./cronX.sh flickpapr`. If that works, put
# something like these (choose one) in your crontab for rotation (`crontab -e`):
#
#     MAILTO = you@example.com
#
#     @hourly .../cronX.sh .../flickpapr
